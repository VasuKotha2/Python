* Truthiness refers to the Boolean evaluation of a value. The truthiness of a value indicates whether the value is truthy or falsy.

* Truthy means any value that evaluates to true in the Boolean context. To determine if a value is truthy, pass it as the argument to bool(). If it returns True, then the value is truthy. Examples of truthy values are non-empty strings, any numbers that arenâ€™t 0, non-empty lists, and many more.

* Falsy means any value that evaluates to false in the Boolean context. To determine if a value is falsy, pass it as the argument to bool(). If it returns False, then the value is falsy. Examples of falsy values are "", 0, [], {}, and set().
